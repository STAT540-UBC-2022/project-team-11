Type II diabetes (T2D) is one of the most chronic diseases worldwide, and one in three Canadians are diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes [1, 2]. T2D is a metabolic disorder that prevents insulin response from cells in the body. This project aims to use longitudinal transcriptomic (RNASeq) data to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways in three groups of patients 1) insulin-resistant, 2) insulin-sensitive, and 3) healthy. We would further like to explore if predicting insulin resistance is possible in a prediabetes state. Zhou et al. [3] first described the dataset used in this project. The objective of their study was to use a multi-omics approach to identify the pathways that differ between the three predefined groups. The authors provide a rich data set by tracking 215 insulin-resistant, 238 insulin-sensitive, and 171 healthy patients for almost four years. In addition to RNA-seq data, we have access to crucial metadata such as age, gender, and Body Mass Index (BMI) that would aid the development of a prediction model.
